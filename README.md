## Overview and Origin

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is an American multinational financial services firm headquartered in New York City. It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.  As the largest of the [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(banking)#United_States "JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo") banks, the firm is considered [systemically important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution "a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis.") by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal ["Fortress Balance Sheet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8DvO205ZU0 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8DvO205ZU0") of capital reserves.

### Company History

**Company Incorporation:**  
Dec 31, 2000 -- J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation. The new firm was named J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

**Incorporation History:**
>JPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies, merged since 1996, combining Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Bank One, as well as asset assumptions of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and First Republic. Predecessors include additional historic, major banking firms, among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, The Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by Aaron Burr. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase")

**Company Founders:**
- Aaron Burr (Bank of the Manhattan Company)
- Balthazar P. Melick, John C. Morrison, Mark Spenser, Gerardus Post, James Jenkins, William A. Seely, and William Stebbins (Chemical Bank)
- John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan & Co.)
- John Thompson (Chase National Bank)

**Fun Fact**  
*Believe it or not, JPMorgan Chase & Co. started as a water business.  The Manhattan Company was founded in 1799 for the purpose of providing quality drinking water.  Who would have guessed that it would grow into the world's the fifth-largest banking institution with $3.9 trillion in total assets.* 

> **1799**  
> **The Manhattan Company is founded**  
> - The Manhattan Company, JPMorgan Chase's earliest predecessor institution, is chartered by the New York State legislature to supply "pure and wholesome" drinking water to the city's growing population.  Among its founders are Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.  
> - A provision in the charter allows The Manhattan Company to use its surplus capital for banking operations.  Within five months, The Bank of The Manhattan Company opens for business, becoming the second commercial bank in New York City after Hamilton’s Bank of New York.
