### Fun Fact
*Believe it or not, JPMorgan Chase & Co. started as a water business in 1799.  Who could have guessed that it would grow into the world's the fifth-largest banking institution with $3.9 trillion in total assets.* 

> **1799**  
> **The Manhattan Company is founded**  
> - The Manhattan Company, JPMorgan Chase's earliest predecessor institution, is chartered by the New York State legislature to supply "pure and wholesome" drinking water to the city's growing population.  Among its founders are Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.  
> - A provision in the charter allows The Manhattan Company to use its surplus capital for banking operations.  Within five months, The Bank of The Manhattan Company opens for business, becoming the second commercial bank in New York City after Hamiltonâ€™s Bank of New York.
