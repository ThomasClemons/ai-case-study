## Overview and Origin

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is an American multinational financial services firm headquartered in New York City. It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.  As the largest of the [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(banking)#United_States "JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo") banks, the firm is considered [systemically important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution "a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis.") by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal ["Fortress Balance Sheet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8DvO205ZU0 "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8DvO205ZU0") of capital reserves.

### Company History

**Company Incorporation:**  
Dec 31, 2000 -- J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated merged with The Chase Manhattan Corporation. The new firm was named J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

**Incorporation History:**
>JPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies, merged since 1996, combining Chase Manhattan Bank, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Bank One, as well as asset assumptions of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual, and First Republic. Predecessors include additional historic, major banking firms, among which are Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, First Chicago Bank, National Bank of Detroit, Texas Commerce Bank, Providian Financial and Great Western Bank. The company's oldest predecessor institution, The Bank of the Manhattan Company, was the third oldest banking corporation in the United States, and the 31st oldest bank in the world, having been established on September 1, 1799, by Aaron Burr. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase")


**Company Founders:**
- Aaron Burr (Bank of the Manhattan Company)
- Balthazar P. Melick, John C. Morrison, Mark Spenser, Gerardus Post, James Jenkins, William A. Seely, and William Stebbins (Chemical Bank)
- John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan & Co.)
- John Thompson (Chase National Bank)

**Fun Fact**  
*Believe it or not, JPMorgan Chase & Co. started as a water business.  The Manhattan Company was founded in 1799 for the purpose of providing quality drinking water.  Who would have guessed that it would grow into the world's the fifth-largest banking institution with $3.67 trillion in total assets.* 

> **1799**  
> **The Manhattan Company is founded**  
> - The Manhattan Company, JPMorgan Chase's earliest predecessor institution, is chartered by the New York State legislature to supply "pure and wholesome" drinking water to the city's growing population.  Among its founders are Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.  
> - A provision in the charter allows The Manhattan Company to use its surplus capital for banking operations.  Within five months, The Bank of The Manhattan Company opens for business, becoming the second commercial bank in New York City after Hamilton’s Bank of New York.

From top to bottom JPMorgan Chase is firmly committed to AI.  My research identified the following:
- It will deliver more than $1.5 billion in business value from artificial intelligence and machine learning efforts in 2023 as it leverages its 500 petabytes of data across 300 use cases in production.
- It will invest $15.3 billion in technology in 2023.
- The Technology budget has grown at a 7% annual rate over the last four years.

Observations:
- JPMorgan Chase outperforms its competitors in virtually every category.
- JPMorgan Chase far exceeds its competitors in AI/ML investment.
- JPMorgan Chase leadership has a clear vision of where it wants to go and it is moving at an accelerated pace when compared with its competitors.

## Recommendation

- JPMorgan Chase is head and shoulders above all financial services companies in the US.  It has a clear vision and is moving at an accelerated pace to deliver on company goals.
- I recommend that JPMorgan Chase share its AI and ML insights with other US banks in areas that will not impact its competitive advantage.  Common areas that won't impact competitive advantage are:
    - Risk Management
    - Fraud Detection
    - Cybersecurity
    - Regulatory Reporting
- The US banking system would benefit in the following ways:
    - **Accelerated knowledge growth in AI/ML** - Most US banks don't have the scale or resources to make advancements in AI/ML as quickly as JPMorgan Chase can.  Sharing insights with these banks would speed up industry growth in AI/ML.
    - **Reduced Technology cost** - Most US banks have limited capital and can only fund the staff and supporting technologies for small, incremental advancements in AI/ML.  Sharing insights with other banks can lead to larger, more significant advancements in AI/ML across the industry, allowing banks to better leverage available capital.
    - **More secure banking business processes and infrastructure** - Banks would have valuable insight for implementing AI/ML to reduce business risk by making systems more secure and reducing credit losses.
    - **Better compliance with Regulatory Reporting Requirements** - It is critical that banks meet rigorous, complicated regulatory reporting requirements.  Banks would have valuable insight for implementing AI/ML to identify regulatory rule changes and overlaps between different regulatory reports to accelerate business process and regulatory reporting changes to maintain compliance.
