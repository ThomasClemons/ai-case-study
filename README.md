**Fun Fact**

> **1799**  
> **The Manhattan Company is founded**  
> - The Manhattan Company, JPMorgan Chase's earliest predecessor institution, is chartered by the New York State legislature to supply "pure and wholesome" drinking water to the city's growing population.  Among its founders are Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr.

Within five months, The Bank of The Manhattan Company opens for business, becoming the second commercial bank in New York City after Hamiltonâ€™s Bank of New York.
